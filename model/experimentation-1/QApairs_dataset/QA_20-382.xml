            <p id="20-382:judgement:factual_background:p1">The United States captured the island of Guam from Spain in 1898, during the Spanish-American War. From 1903, the United States maintained military rule until the passage of the Guam Organic Act in 1950, which formally transferred power from the United States to Guam’s newly formed civilian government. Guam remains an “unincorporated territory of the United States.”</p>
            <p id="20-382:judgement:factual_background:p2">In the 1940s, the Navy constructed and operated the Ordot Dump for the disposal of municipal and military waste, allegedly including munitions and chemicals such as DDT and Agent Orange, and continued to use the landfill throughout the Korean and Vietnam Wars. The Ordot Dump lacked basic environmental safeguards, and as a result, contaminants were released into the Lonfit River, which ultimately flows into the Pacific Ocean.</p>
            <p id="20-382:judgement:factual_background:p3">In 1983, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) added the Ordot Dump to its National Priorities List, and in 1988, it designated the Navy as a potentially responsible party. However, because the Navy had relinquished sovereignty over the island, Guam remained the owner and operator of the Ordot Dump. As such, the EPA repeatedly ordered Guam to propose plans for containing and disposing of waste at the landfill.</p>
            <p id="20-382:judgement:factual_background:p4">In 2002, the EPA sued Guam under the Clean Water Act, asking the court to require Guam to comply with the Act, in part by submitting plans and a compliance schedule for a cover system of the Ordot Dump, and by completing construction of the cover system. The EPA and Guam agreed that Guam would pay a civil penalty, close the Ordot Dump, and design a cover system. Guam closed the Ordot Dump in 2011.</p>
            <p id="20-382:judgement:factual_background:p5">In 2017, Guam sued the United States, alleging that the Navy was responsible for the Ordot Dump’s contamination and was thus responsible for the costs of closing and remediating the landfill. Guam’s claims rested on two provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Section 107 allows for a “cost-recovery” action and Section 113(f) allows for a “contribution” action. The statute of limitations for the former action is six years, compared to only three for the latter. The district court concluded that Guam’s agreement with the EPA did not trigger section 113, so Guam could maintain its section 107 claim against the United States. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reversed.</p>

            <heading level="1">Holding / Conclusion</heading>
            <p id="20-382:judgement:holding:p1">Guam can pursue its lawsuit against the federal government over the cleaning costs associated with the Ordot Dump. Justice Clarence Thomas authored the unanimous opinion of the Court.</p>
            <p id="20-382:judgement:holding:p2">Subsection 113(f) allows a party to seek contribution “from any other person who is liable or potentially liable under section 107(a) of CERCLA” and provides that “a person who has resolved its liability to the United States . . . may seek contribution from any person who is not party to a settlement referred to in § 113(F)(2).” The language and structure of this statute support the interpretation that the right of contribution is predicated on CERCLA liability. Because the statutory language is best understood only in reference to CERCLA, the most natural reading of the provision is that a party may seek contribution under CERCLA only after settling a CERCLA-specific liability, not resolving environmental liability under some other law. Thus, the agreement between the EPA and Guam did not trigger the statute of limitations for seeking contribution.</p>

  <QAPairs caseId="20-382" caseName="Territory of Guam v. United States">
    <Pair>
      <Question>What two specific provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) did Guam rely on for its 2017 lawsuit, and how do their statutes of limitations differ?</Question>
      <Answer>Guam relied on Section 107 for a "cost-recovery" action, which has a six-year statute of limitations, and Section 113(f) for a "contribution" action, which has a three-year statute of limitations.</Answer>
    </Pair>
    <Pair>
      <Question>What was the Supreme Court's interpretation of CERCLA Section 113(f) that permitted Guam to maintain its lawsuit against the United States?</Question>
      <Answer>The Court held that the right of contribution under Section 113(f) is predicated on CERCLA liability, meaning a contribution action is only triggered by settling a CERCLA-specific liability, not environmental liability resolved under some other law (like the Clean Water Act).</Answer>
    </Pair>
    <Pair>
      <Question>What was the procedural consequence of the District Court and the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reaching opposite conclusions regarding whether Guam’s agreement with the EPA triggered CERCLA Section 113?</Question>
      <Answer>The District Court’s conclusion (that Section 113 was not triggered) allowed Guam to pursue the longer six-year statute of limitations under Section 107. The D.C. Circuit’s reversal would have subjected Guam to the shorter three-year statute of limitations under Section 113(f).</Answer>
    </Pair>
    <Pair>
      <Question>What two specific chemicals were alleged to have been disposed of at the Ordot Dump, and where did the contaminants ultimately travel?</Question>
      <Answer>The waste allegedly included chemicals such as DDT and Agent Orange. Contaminants were released into the Lonfit River, which ultimately flows into the Pacific Ocean.</Answer>
    </Pair>
    <Pair>
      <Question>What two historical events define the period during which the U.S. Navy constructed and operated the Ordot Dump, and what body formally transferred power to the civilian government?</Question>
      <Answer>The Navy constructed and operated the dump beginning in the 1940s and continued to use it throughout the Korean and Vietnam Wars. The Guam Organic Act in 1950 formally transferred power from the U.S. to Guam’s newly formed civilian government.</Answer>
    </Pair>
    <Pair>
      <Question>What was the basis for the EPA designating Guam, and not just the Navy, as the owner and operator of the Ordot Dump despite the Navy’s role in its operation?</Question>
      <Answer>The EPA designated Guam as the owner and operator because the Navy had relinquished sovereignty over the island in 1950, even though the Navy had constructed and operated the dump for decades.</Answer>
    </Pair>
    <Pair>
      <Question>What specific federal statute was used by the EPA when it sued Guam in 2002, and what three key actions did Guam agree to take in the subsequent settlement?</Question>
      <Answer>The EPA sued Guam under the Clean Water Act. In the agreement, Guam would pay a civil penalty, design a cover system, and close the Ordot Dump (which occurred in 2011).</Answer>
    </Pair>
    <Pair>
      <Question>According to the Court’s interpretation of the statutory language, what specific type of liability must be resolved in a settlement to satisfy the requirements for seeking contribution under CERCLA Section 113(f)?</Question>
      <Answer>The settlement must resolve a "CERCLA-specific liability" for the right of contribution to be triggered, as the statutory language is best understood only in reference to CERCLA itself.</Answer>
    </Pair>
    <Pair>
      <Question>In what year was the Navy designated a potentially responsible party by the EPA, and what year did Guam file its lawsuit against the United States?</Question>
      <Answer>The Navy was designated a potentially responsible party in 1988, and Guam filed its lawsuit against the United States in 2017.</Answer>
    </Pair>
    <Pair>
      <Question>What was the final disposition of the case, including the vote count and the identity of the Justice who authored the unanimous opinion?</Question>
      <Answer>The Supreme Court affirmed that Guam can pursue its lawsuit against the federal government, winning the case in a unanimous (9-0) opinion authored by Justice Clarence Thomas.</Answer>
